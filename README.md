2) List five significant features of React
a. JSX (Javascript Syntax Extension)
b. Virtual DOM
c. Performance
d. Components
e. One-way data binding

3) List five major advantages of React
a. Allows writing of custom components using JSX
b. It is simple
c. React components are reusable
d. It is flexible and easy to learn
e. It offers improved performance

4) What is the name of the Software Engineer that created React? Also, which company owns React?
Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Meta (formerly Facebook).
React is a  free and open-source library maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook)


5) What are the notable differences between HTML & JSX? Give at least 3 of them
a) In JSX, you must always return a single root element
b) In JSX, you use camelCase when writing props and event references e.g class in JSX is className, for in JSX is htmlFor, onclick in JSX is onClick
c) In JSX, we have props not attributes
d) In JSX, class and for are a reserved words, thus they are written as className and htmlFor respectively

6) Why canâ€™t browsers read JSX?
Browsers can't read JSX because it is not a regular javascript object. JSX is a syntax extension of javascript, JSX is not intended to be implemented by browsers. It is intended to be used by a transpiler, like babel which transforms it into javascript, and then the browser is able to read it.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
